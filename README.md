# Outliner

I want to learn Apple Development, and don't know what to create. Then, John Gruber's tweet inspired me:

## Why Objective-C?

Some reasons:
1. I want to learn the "new" and "old" way of Apple Development. I know that many SwiftUI's features are great. I just wanted to _learn bottom-up_, while if I use Swift first, I think that is a _top-down_ approach.
2. I develop with React Native too. Most of [React Native modules][rnmodules] use Objective-C for their iOS Native Module.

Let's learn! :D
